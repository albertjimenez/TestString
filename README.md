# TestString - GestionHospital App
Not anymore a testApp even if the package name says itself test
--Porting Gestion Hospital
-> Model is fully supported. Just need to redo the view-controller.

-> Implemented FIREBASE API, which is responsible to perform load/save data to & from the cloud. One thing less...

-> It remains to do from the view:
    
    --Create the buttons:
        
        --Add
        --Edit
        --Redo the search / display button
